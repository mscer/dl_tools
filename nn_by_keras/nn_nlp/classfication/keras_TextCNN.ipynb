       "['Sisters in law will be released theatrically on march 24th in Sweden. A good occasion for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It was shown in GÃ¶teborg together with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto, \"director in focus\" of the festival. She gave a master class, very much appreciated, telling about her method as documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances which led her to shoot Sisters in law twice : the first version got lost for good, so a second shooting was organized and the film turned out to be different at the end. A pretty awful problem happened, in this case, to create the possibility of a very strong movie.',\n",
       " 'In a year of pretentious muck like \"Synecdoche, New York\" a film born out of Charlie Kaufman\\'s own self-indulgence, comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important. \"Frownland\" is a labor of love by the crew, the actors and the filmmaker, shot over years by friends. It traces a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic, REAL Brooklyn world. The people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the \"mumblecore\" movement. They are real people, painfully trapped in their own self-contained neuroses, unwilling to change, unable. The real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch, it is very difficult to watch. It is 16mm film-making without proper light, money or any of the other factors that would make a film \"slick\", but its honesty can not be understated, a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for Richard Linklater to give it an award as he did at SXSW. This does remind of films like \"Naked\" or the best of the \"mumblecore\". It is a film that is not for everyone, but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it.']"
